= Deciding on the Implementation
:navtitle: Select a manager

Axon Framework does not create a `DeadlineManager` automatically for you, and you will have to choose from a set of implementations.
When setting up deadlines for sagas it's best to choose a solution based on the saga storage solution.
For deadlines in aggregates, it is best to choose the same storage solution as the Event Store.
In case you use Axon Server, it's best to store deadlines in the same solution as your projections.
If you are using a relational database, the `DbSchedulerDeadlineManager` is the best choice.
For MongoDB the `JobRunrDeadlineManager` would be a good second.
Both solutions require a database as a synchronization and persistence layer.
For now, we will stick to the `SimpleDeadlineManager` as it is easier to use.
Note that the `SimpleDeadlineManager` should not be regarded as production-ready, as it does not persist deadlines or communicate between application instances.
