= Advanced Use Cases

As the deadline is used currently, we don't use the ability to cancel deadlines.
In the case of a gift card, we might not publish an event that the gift card expired, when it was already depleted.
Let's make a few changes to enable this.
The first thing to need to do, is to add a `remainingValue` to the aggregate, so we know when there is no value remaining.
Then we need to add the command handler:

[source,java]
----
@CommandHandler
public void handle(RedeemCardCommand command, DeadlineManager deadlineManager) {
    //check validity
    apply(new CardRedeemedEvent(giftCardId, command.amount()));
    if (remainingValue == 0) {
        deadlineManager.cancelAllWithinScope(EXPIRED_GIFT_CARD); // <1>
    }
}
----

<1> This will cancel all deadlines with the name for this aggregate instance.
It's possible to use the return value from scheduling a deadline, to cancel a specific deadline.
In this case we are not using multiple of the same named deadlines, so this is easier.

And the event sourcing handler:

[source,java]
----
@EventSourcingHandler
public void on(CardRedeemedEvent event) {
    remainingValue -= event.amount();
}
----

We should also add a test:

[source,java]
----
@Test
void testCardNotExpiringIfNothingLeft() {
    testFixture.givenNoPriorActivity()
               .andGivenCommands(
                       new IssueExpiringCardCommand(CARD_ID, DAYS, AMOUNT),
                       new RedeemCardCommand(CARD_ID, AMOUNT)
               )
               .whenTimeElapses(Duration.ofDays(31L))
               .expectSuccessfulHandlerExecution()
               .expectNoEvents();
}
----

This should help get you started with deadlines.
Don't forget to switch the implementation to one of the deadline managers which offer persistence before moving to prod.
