:navtitle: Select a manager

In most cases there would not be an autoconfigured deadline manager available.
It's best to choose a solution based on the Saga store for deadlines used in Saga's.
For deadlines in aggregates it best to choose the same as the Event Store.
In the case you use Axon Server it's likely best to use what you use for the projections.
If you are using a relational database, the `DbSchedulerDeadlineManager` is the best choice for MongoDB the `JobRunrDeadlineManager` is a good second.

Both those solutions require a database as synchronisation and persistence layer.
For now, we will stick to the `SimpleDeadlineManager` which is easier to use, but is used only by a single instance, and doesn't persist the set deadlines.
