= Deadlines in Axon Framework
:navtitle: Deadlines

== Introduction

Sometimes you don't want to trigger an aggregate or saga directly, but only after some time has past.
When this is the case you can use a Deadline.
If the event you want to publish is a non domain event, a scheduled event might be better fit.
In order to use deadlines you need a `DeadlineManager`

This howto will guide you through the basics of starting to work with deadlines.
This includes configuring a deadline manager, and writing a test for a deadline.
Finally, we will show some more advanced use cases by improving the solution.
As example, we will model expiring a gift card after a certain amount of time.
